Hello, and welcome to my little piece of the Internet. I enjoy talking about myself almost as much as I enjoy 

a good bowl of soup(there is no such thing as a good bowl of soup). So here are the facts. 

<br>
<br>
My name is Paul Foley. I grew up in Green Harbor, Massachusetts. I graduated from Northeastern University in 2012 with a 

Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I like chicken, I like salad, but I don't like chicken salad. 
<br>
<br>
So, that's a little bit about me. If you want to know more, feel free to <a class="link" href="php/contact/contact.php">contact ME</a>. 
From time to time I'll add articles to the site about things I find interestiong and hopefully you'll find some of them interesting too.
